Welcome to slate money your guide to the business and finance news of the week. I'm Felix Salmon of Axios. I'm here with Elizabeth Spires of New York Times and other places. Hello. Elizabeth is showing off her amazing tattoos, which we will talk about later in the show. We are also joined and this is extremely exciting by the one and only Cardiff Garcia. Hello. Welcome back Cardiff. Thanks. You are always fun to be here. Just the perfect slate money guest slash co-host. You just do everything. Introduce yourself though for those few slate money listeners who are not deeply familiar with your Earth. Who are you? So, I am the host of the New Bazaar podcast and I do some other things, but that's the one I would chill for, but maybe more importantly for our purposes, I am kind of an OG economics blogger like Felix and a former econ journalist at the Financial Times and NPR and places like that. So, we are going to talk about Disney, ESPN, Bastille Sports, sports gambling, all of that kind of stuff that is going to segue elegantly into Cardiff's hobby, which is face punching. Face punching. Yeah. And the economics thereof. Apparently, there's billions of dollars in face punching if you structure it correctly. Oh yeah. We are then going to nerd the **** out on private credit because this is slate money and this is what we do, but you will have Cardiff to guide you and so it will be painless. We have a slate plus segment on WeWork. Spoiler alert. It's doing really badly. It's all coming up on slate money. For a limited time, minimum $10 per order. Additional terms apply.

Disney is famous for being incredibly protective of its incredibly pristine brand and I remember back when they bought Miramax. Everyone was like, how on earth are they going to be able to cope with R-rated movies when they're Disney? There's always been this arm of Disney called ESPN that has been relatively but not entirely pristine, but it has always been, as long as I can remember, it's been owned by Disney. Partly for that reason, mainly for that reason I would say, ESPN has been like, we are not going to get into grubby things like sports betting. Betting is bad. So, what changed, Elizabeth, because now they seem to be getting into sports betting? Yeah, I think it's just Eiger trying to figure out what to do with ESPN and recognizing that gaming is a huge industry. So, it's just a money grab and I think he assumes that because it's going to be branded as an ESPN property, the average person doesn't know it's a Disney operation. So, it's a matter of just separating the brands, I think. So, I think that's right. I think the ESPN brand and the Disney brand are kind of two different brands and you can take ESPN into the grubby depths of sports betting and Penn National, which is the afterthought betting company and no one will think less of The Little Mermaid as a result. Yeah, although I will say that Eiger has shown some interest in selling at least a minority stake in ESPN to minority shareholders. Or possibly even a majority stake. And I think it's been reported that they're open to just like spinning the whole thing off. I think they would like to keep it a little bit, but yeah, they, you know, ESPN is on the block. Shit is getting real at Disney. They aren't making nearly as much money from streaming as they were from, you know, the olden days and so they are thinking the unthinkable and one of the unthinkable things that they're thinking is like, okay, for a couple billion dollars, maybe we should allow our brand to be used for betting. I don't think that it's a super money grab. I don't think it's enough money that it would be enough to cause ESPN to give up valued principles. I think that first the principles go, you know, you're like everything is on the table now because we have to make some money somehow. And then once the principles are gone, you're like, okay, we can make a couple billion dollars by doing this with Penn and fine, we will. It's not like they gave up their principles for the money, but I think they gave up the principles first as a strategic decision. I think it's decent money for ESPN. It's small potatoes for Disney, but I will say this is quite a heel turn for Bob Iger, who's come storming back into the CEO chair to get rid of the guy that he had chosen as his successor. He's now making comments about the writers guild of America and how their demands are unrealistic in their strike. He's jacking up the price of Disney Plus, their subscription thing, and he's cracking down on like the cherished American tradition of password sharing, right? Like this is, I mean, this is a guy who's come back and he's like, I have to be bold in what I'm doing. Will it work? Will it not work? I have no idea, but this seems of a piece with him coming back and realizing, especially that the streaming model just isn't going to sort of do what he had expected it to do and that the business model for Disney does have to change quite radically. With hindsight, this is too late. Like if you're going to get into betting, the time to get into betting was the last time he was CEO, back when Fanjul and DraftKings were competing aggressively with each other to get market share and customers, and they would have happily given up some absolutely enormous chunk of equity in order to get the ESPN branding. Now, both of them are like, we don't even need you, which is why Disney is forced to go with this also ran company called Penn National Gaming or whatever the hell they're called with 2% market share, which, you know, in the best case scenario will, you know, thanks to ESPN get 4% market share or something. Like it's kind of sad. Like Disney is meant to be this great dominant company which dominates every industry it's in. It's never going to dominate this one. I mean, I think online betting is still relatively new. You know, it was largely enabled by a Supreme Court decision in 2018. So, I take your point that DraftKings and Fanjul already have a huge chunk of the market, but, you know, Penn Entertainment's earlier deal was with Barstool Sports and that was a disaster partly because Barstool is a disaster and Dave Portner is a disaster. You know, it's a little unclear what they can do with us if with Disney as a partner instead of, you know, it's a nightmare company. It does seem like a pretty small deal though relative to what those other guys are doing to the other DraftKings and Fanjul. But maybe there's still potential there and I say that because so many of the states that have recently legalized sports gambling are in a kind of race to the bottom it seems to loosen standards and to attract more gaming or more sports gambling into their states because it's such a big source of revenue. So, this could continue, right? Like it could be that sports gambling is something the revenues are still to be made. No, I think sports gambling revenues are in the future to be sure. I just don't think that Penn is going to be a significant player even with the ESPN branding partly because, you know, the reason why people go to sportsbooks is because of like liquidity and prices and technology and all of that not because it has a dumb media brand on it. So, but you know, I could be wrong about this. I'm highly bearish on the prospect for Penn which as we have discussed, you know, their last bright idea was let's get Barstool Sports on board. What did they pay like half a billion dollars? Half a billion dollars for this dumb like bro company. Rebranded their entire sportsbook as Barstool and then all of the, you know, states that are legalizing sports gambling and stuff were like, really? Barstool? Bad guy? And they made it even harder and they were like, okay, never mind. And this is my, it's absolutely amazing. They sell Barstool back to its like douchebag founder, Portnoy, for one dollar. So, he sells it for 580 million. He buys it back for one. People are like, well, of course, you know, he could drive that hard bargain because Barstool without Portnoy is nothing. So, he's, you know, like it would be silly to try and sell it to anyone else. But the fact is, honestly, it's not even worth one dollar. It is, you know, it has been losing money consistently. There's no obvious way for it to make money now that it can't do sports betting anymore. You know, as a media company, the advertisers won't touch it with a ten-foot pole, right? You really get like the kind of advertisers who are, you know, okay with Twitter, you know, at this point. Do you think that ESPN, if it hadn't been yoked to Disney, would have tried to start its own sports and gambling operation years ago, maybe at the time that FanDuel and DraftKings were getting going and that it's precisely because it was owned by this company. I think there would have been like, yeah, they would have wound up in some kind of joint venture with one of those guys, got a bunch of, you know what, it would have been a bit like the record labels with Spotify, you know, they would have like gone in, got a bunch of equity, like aligned incentives, all of that kind of stuff. But back when those companies like DraftKings would have really benefited from the ESPN branding and they would have appreciated it now, there's such big names, you know, on their own that who cares, right? ESPN is the one that's late to the game. That's what's a little bit sad, I guess, about all this. Is sports gambling... I enter into a lot of bets. We're about to enter into a bet in Slate Plus, I believe. That's right. But sports gambling is just like, I'm like, no. I mean, mainly because I don't kid myself that I have any information about it, not that having information about it actually seems to help. Yeah. I mean, it's also just part of a very sort of heated debate going on right now about its likely effects now that it is legal, right? Is it something that's like, I don't know, whiskey and cigarettes where a little bit every now and again is fine, adds some enjoyment to your life, but it's a short road from like a little bit to moderate and it's an even shorter road from moderate to becoming a really damaging addictive thing. And so I'm going to say I'm going to push back on two of those. Okay. Number one, a little bit of cigarettes is not fine. Well, I mean, it's a small amount every now and again, social smoker, but you don't become addicted. But number two, yes, certainly compared to nicotine, but even compared to alcohol, I think gambling is not super addictive. It can be, you know, if you have an addictive personality, there are definitely people who are addicted to gambling. But I think as a percentage of all gamblers, that is lower than it is with most other addictive things. But yeah, we are 100% going to see an increase in the number of people who are addicted to gambling now that it is so easy. Also, one of the problems that Penn had with Barstool is that Portnoy would get up and encourage people to make insane bets and brag about being addicted to gambling. His own father referred to him as a degenerate gambler. They're at insurreglatory problems because of it. Shocking. But yeah, and then like when he made his fortune selling Barstool to Penn, what did he do? He became like a meemy online degenerate gambler in meme stocks. And he famously had this thing saying stocks only go up and he clearly just loves gambling everywhere and every how. Those are some of the least horrible things, by the way, that he's been accused of. This is not a good dude. And just want to be clear, I'm not encouraging anybody to smoke except maybe pot on occasion or something like that. But no, don't start smoking cigarettes. Okay. Thank you for clearing that up. Public service announcement. Right. No, I just think like the reason I make the comparison is because some people think it's like, hey, it's a vice like any vice. You know, it should stay legal but done every now and again. It's okay. But taken too far can be really damaging. It's probably not as damaging as alcohol. You know, so like on some kind of a libertarian argument, you know, if we are free to become alcoholics and to drink as much as we like, why would we not be free to do sports gambling, which in the grand scheme of things is much less harmful? You know, if I'm an addicted sports gambler and I get behind the wheel of a car, I am not actually a particular danger to the other people on the road. It's not going to technically kill you. I guess that's the point you're making. Or other people. You know, it's not like, you know, physically dangerous in that way. The threat is to your own life, not to that of others. Or it's not even- Livelihood. Livelihood. Yeah. Whereas, and here's my wonderful segue. Oh, here we go. Getting punched in the face repeatedly. Oh, very nice. Really is quite dangerous and we would not recommend that. We're going to talk about how much one should get paid to get punched in the face repeatedly.

I think you're referring to the next segment, which is about this UFC lawsuit, this lawsuit brought by former fighters in the UFC, which is the largest by far promotional organization that runs mixed martial arts fights. Which is now this segment. Yes. Here we are, here we are. Yeah, here we are. This week, the reason this is in the news right now is because a judge certified that that lawsuit, which was brought by six or seven former fighters in the UFC, can now be a class action lawsuit, which means that I think about 1200 fighters who fought in the UFC between 2010 and 2017 can now join and in fact are part of this lawsuit. What they're alleging is that the UFC has used anti-competitive tactics to keep down the wages of UFC fighters in the UFC. That's what all this is about. Okay. First of all, Cardiff, because you are here and we don't have you on this show nearly often enough, but we're going to take full advantage of you being here. First of all, what the hell is a UFC? Okay. Stands for Ultimate Fighting Championship, right? That's the name of the organization that runs MMA, Mixed Martial Arts. Mixed Martial Arts is- Is Mixed Martial Arts and Ultimate Fighting the same thing? Yeah. Okay. All right. So basically it's a style of fighting- Because I thought Ultimate Fighting was fighting with frisbees. Ultimate Frisbees, right. You know what? Introducing frisbees into mixed martial arts fights would be fun, but no, basically these are fights in which a fighter can use the different tactics from a variety of martial arts disciplines. So it includes things like jiu-jitsu, wrestling, boxing, Muay Thai, kickboxing, things like that, and it's all combined into one thing. The UFC is by far the biggest organization that puts on these fights, and by most estimates, it gets about 90% of the revenues in the whole sport. How did it do that? A few different ways. One is in the 2000s, it was genuinely like an entrepreneurially impressive organization, but it also bought out all of its rivals, in some cases shutting them down. So it has very few rivals left right now that have anything close to being competitive with the UFC. The fighters basically said that because of this, the UFC is not just a monopoly, it's also a monopsony. And for listeners who aren't familiar with this term, this is basically when there's one employer, and so the fighters have to basically agree to the terms, or the workers have to agree to the terms of that employer because they can't leave to go somewhere else. And that because the UFC has this position, it's able to use coercive contracts and coercive tactics during the life of those contracts to keep the fighter's wages down. That's what this case is all about. And the key thing here is that the UFC allegedly, and probably in fact, behaved in an anti-competitive way by doing things like buying up its competitors and shutting them down. And if it hadn't been anti-competitive in that way, then the fighters could have played one fighting league off against another and then gone to the highest bidder. Now there's only one bidder, and so the fighters have no choice but to take the low pay from the UFC. That is a clear violation of all antitrust principles. And so the potential remedies here that they could win are quite enormous. And doesn't your heart just bleed for Endeavor, which owns the UFC and might have to pay out all of these workers? Yeah. It's not just the remedies that they might have to pay to the fighters in this class action suit. It's also that they might have to change the way that they design these contracts so as to be less anti-competitive. So I'll tell you about the one tactic that's really been frustrating to so many of the fighters and that's in this lawsuit. When a UFC fighter signs up to fight for the UFC, it's not just for one fight. Usually they'll say, okay, you fight for us for six fights. We'll pay you X amount for those fights. And how much do they get paid? So it depends on how good you are. This really varies quite dramatically. But what happens is that, let's say you, Felix Salmon, are fighting in the UFC now, right? Terrifying. I would be terrified. Everyone would be terrified of me. Can I place a bet on that right now? Right. Or me, right? To win. No comment. But let's say you sign up for a six fight contract and you fought five fights and you're like, great, I can't wait for my new contract. And if I don't like the new contract, I'll go fight for a competitor, right? The UFC will go to you and say, nope, you need to sign a new contract with us before this contract ends or we won't give you that six fight. And you end up in limbo, possibly indefinitely. The UFC did this multiple times and it was in this lawsuit. And this is something that the fighters are trying to get the UFC to stop by partly making these contracts shorter term in nature by having sunset provisions so that if the UFC doesn't offer you a fight by a certain period of time, then that contract is over and then you can leave and go fight for somebody else. Like when Mark Zuckerberg sets up a rival league. Maybe. Who knows? I mean, like we just saw, didn't we just see a whole bunch of Silicon Valley CEO types set up a cricket league? Yeah. I feel like that's much more civilized, but like Mark Zuckerberg is not particularly civilized and he's famously into mixed martial arts. So like how hard would it be? Like how big is the moat here? How hard would it be for a billionaire to wake up one morning and say, I'm going to compete with UFC? Really hard. And part of the problem is that the UFC really has locked up so many of the best fighters into these contracts already. And it was able to do that by dint of stuff that it did in the 2000s when it was buying up all of its competitors. And so that's one problem is just getting all of the best talent over to this new organization that you're going to set up. You'd have to get a lot of them out of their UFC contracts first. So like that I think is the biggest moat. But also any company that already has just by virtue of status quo bias, 90% of the revenues in the sport just has a huge inbuilt advantage. You'd have to like promote the hell out of this new company. You'd have to like do something different. You'd have to find some way to get big enough fighters who have managed to find their way out of UFC contracts. By the way, some organizations have done this and it's not that they're completely unsuccessful, right? They're there. They're still alive for now, but very few. I mean, if Netflix, for example, had 90% of all the revenues in the streaming space, we would all say this is a ludicrous concentration of an industry, right? And that's what's been going on in the UFC. It kind of did for a while. So if the fighters win the lawsuit, do those contracts get renegotiated? I think the fighters in the lawsuit themselves would get like back pay what they think their wage share would have been if in fact like these contracts had been fair the whole time. And there's different ways that like sports lawyers are like trying to calculate what that would be. But I think it would also change the way the UFC makes contracts going forward, which by the way would be a big hit to its business model. It's deliberate business model. And we know this because of some of the internal documents that have come out in the course of this lawsuit was to keep the wage share down. That's how the former owners of the UFC were able to sell the UFC to Ari Emanuel and Endeavor and some private equity firms for $4 billion. The valuations were high precisely because the labor compensation was low. And that was their strategy, which they admitted in these documents. This isn't me speculating. Right. But and then Endeavor just recently bought the wrestling- WWE. Equivalent of UFC, which has, I'm going to say, like similar economics in that like it has kind of a monopoly on that sport as well. Yeah. I mean, I know less about the WWE, but accusations that it also engages in monopsonistic tactics have been there for decades at this point. Yeah. And the corporate finance angle here is that apparently Endeavor wants to combine the WWE with the UFC and then spin them out into its, as their own sort of men hitting each other company. And women. There are women in this too? Absolutely. There are several women's divisions in the UFC. I would like to see a niche business where it's just billionaires fighting each other. Or just billionaires fighting each other. I feel like the number of billionaires who want to do that is exactly two. It's hard to scale that. Is that them fighting each other? I'd be fine with just two of them fighting. Just those two. Just those two. Slate Money is sponsored this week by Progressive as any good progressive organization. It wants to empower you.

Oh, because Cardiff Garcia is our favorite finance nerd. And when we have a finance nerd on here, we need to get nerdy. So let me set the stage here and then you can explain what's going on. Okay. Broadly speaking, there are two ways the companies borrow money. There are bonds and there are loans. If you want to borrow from banks, you do that with a bank loan and that's often floating rate debt. And then alternatively, if you want to borrow from the capital markets and non-banks, you issue a bond and then a whole bunch of people bid on your bond and they trade it and it trades. Then there's this new strange animal called private credit, which is basically borrowing from non-banks, but it's still a loan. So Cardiff explain number one, why does this thing exist? Okay. And number two, why does it seem to be having a resurgence right now? Yeah, those are, I think part of the same answer, which is that right now, because interest rates have been climbing, the business model for the banks is getting kind of squeezed on all sides. So the value of the loans that banks have made have plummeted and those are their assets because interest rates are higher. But also the depositors, which banks need partly to help fund some of those loans have multiple options because interest rates are also higher. So the banks both have to pay more to their depositors or the depositors can flee and go to money market funds. And consequently, what's happening is that a lot of banks are getting out of the business or shying away from the business of lending in particular to small and mid-sized companies because their business model's bad and a lot of these loans are considered somewhat risky. So enter private credit, which has really become more and more popular over the course of the last year. And the definition of private credit is a little bit amorphous, but in terms of what we're talking about here, the simple definition is this. Private credit funds raise money from investors. Those investors tend to be large institutions like pension funds or nonprofits or rich individuals. But like I can't go on to an exchange or call my broker or whatever and invest in one of these funds. You have to qualify for this kind of thing. So it raises money from these investors. And then what they do is, this is the biggest category of private credit funds. They lend directly to these small and mid-sized, typically private companies. And in many cases, they'll originate the loan, they'll tailor the loan. It is usually a floating rate loan or they can sometimes buy a loan that already exists. And so what they're doing is they're plugging the gap that's been left by the banks, which have kind of gotten out of this business. So they do other things too. They invest in all kinds of other credit, but that's the thing that everybody's talking about. And at least according to the Fed, that is also the biggest category of private credit lending. So that's what private credit funds do. Now, final question just to sort of set the stage here. Is a private credit fund the same as a CLO? No, it's not. So a CLO is a security in which a number of bank loans leverage big money. Bank loans leverage bank loans, risky bank loans. So these are originated by banks and not by private credit. Correct. Got it. Okay. So now we understand the big picture, which is that private credit funds are basically taking the place of banks in terms of lending to small and medium companies. Presumably, the reason these companies aren't issuing bonds is they're just not big enough. Probably. It's a good question. Maybe they don't think that they have, they would have successful access to bond markets. Or it would be just very expensive to do all of that capital market stuff. Exactly. They're not big enough to do it. If they're not even able to get loans from the banks, and these are smaller companies, so maybe these are even banks that they've had longstanding relationships with, maybe they just don't think they'd be successful in the bond market. Yeah. If you can't get a bank loan, it's very unlikely you'll be able to issue a bond. Yeah. Okay. So that's the big picture. When I read stories about this, there always seems to be a bit of sort of agitator about it. People are like, we think this should probably be bad somehow, and we're going to come up with reasons why it could be bad and should be bad or might be bad. Is this bad? I'll be honest. I sometimes have that same instinctive nervousness, because anytime you hear that some part of the modern financial landscape has employed some sense of adaptability or ingenuity or innovation, yeah, you get nervous because that can be good. But also, we've seen in the past how all kinds of innovations can lead to risks that we don't understand. In this case though, these private credit funds, number one, have what are known as lockup periods, which means that investors can't just pull their money out whenever they want. That money's locked up for five or 10 years, unlike depositors in a bank which can flee. Second, as far as we know, these funds don't use very much leverage. They don't borrow much money to then invest in further credit. So in that sense, they're actually safer than banks, because banks by their nature are much more levered. That is certainly the argument they're making, yes, and it's not implausible. Yeah. There's also some default risk though with the small businesses that are barring. Do you think it's a riskier asset class than the kinds of businesses who can get loans from traditional banks? I mean, probably, but the thing that I do worry a little bit about, and I just have zero idea if this will end up being a problem later on down the line, is that the borrower's experience, if times get tough, might be very different from if they had a loan from the bank. And what I mean by that is that these private credit funds are often run by large firms. Many of them still are huge private equity firms that are skilled in the dark arts of getting their money back when it looks like one of their borrowers can't pay them back. And I just don't know what that means for a situation where some of these companies start going bankrupt, which they will. Right. So the first big thing is, obviously, if you're small and medium-sized companies, some of those will default. Some of those loans will default, right? That's just statistically inevitable. If you get a wave of defaults to banks, that's really bad because it can hit their capital and it can make the bank fragile. If you get a wave of defaults to private credit funds, it's kind of no harm, no foul on a systemic basis, right? Like a bunch of investors in the private credit fund lose some money, who cares, right? Obviously, the borrower is sad that they went bankrupt, but the borrower goes bankrupt either way, right? But it's actually, I think, even better than that. If you are a borrower from a bank and you run into trouble, the bank will kind of look at you and go, you're in trouble and cut off credit. Private credit funds in general, and this is a little bit anecdotal, but it does seem to be the case, they're more willing to restructure to what they call extend and pretend, like to basically just push off your maturities, to do things to make sure that you don't actually have to file for bankruptcy because they're more exposed to you. If you go bust, then they lose money and they try and keep that loan rolling over to avoid losing money. I kind of think that in a weird way, the default rate will go down as a result of these people borrowing from private credit rather than banks. That also strikes me as quite plausible. I just don't know. The thing that I sometimes think about is when, for example, a private equity firm, many of which are running these private credit funds, get into a fight with what are known as distressed debt hedge funds over the assets of a particular company that that private equity firm has bought and is now in default on some of its debt. They start fighting over the assets of the company instead of figuring out how to make the company run better. You know what I mean? In a situation where a private credit fund is owed money, they might do exactly what you're talking about, Felix, where they're like, listen, we want you to stay in business so that you can keep paying us back. Or they might start saying, the heck with this, we just want to get paid back as quickly as possible. Sell that asset that you have. If you end up not being a surviving business later on, what do we care? I just have no idea. I want to believe the story you're telling, and it sounds incredibly likely to me, but I just don't know. The other thing I would say is that the Federal Reserve did a brief study about this in its recent financial stability report, and it said two funny things almost side by side. It said, private credit funds are investment vehicles about which very little is known. We also don't think that they are a systemic risk. It's like, we don't know what they're up to, partly because they're private, but they also don't think it's a systemic risk. I happen not to be too super worried about private credit funds being a huge risk to the financial system, but I also don't know anything that the Fed doesn't know certainly, or that it's reported. I agree on both counts. I have this general feeling that by side institutions in general, investors don't really pose a systemic risk. If I'm an investor, what I have is assets. I have some bonds, I have some stocks, I have some loans, and the value of those bonds, the stocks and loans, they can go up, they can go down. If I'm a good investor, they'll go up. If I'm a bad investor, they'll go down. It's not clear how the value of my investments going up or down poses a systemic risk to anyone unless I have a bunch of leverage and there's danger there. That's where banks come in. Banks pose a systemic risk for a bunch of reasons, mainly though that we have this thing called fractional reserve banking and there's a bunch of embedded leverage in them. As a result of that, banks are highly regulated. I think this is right. As long as you have these long only funds, buying loans and investing in small companies and stuff, that's fine. The reason we don't know much about what's going on in private credit is precisely that they're much, much less regulated than banks. Correct. There is a little bit of a regulatory arbitrage here, but I just feel like there's a good reason for them to be less regulated than banks and that's precisely that. They're not that risky on a systemic basis. They take all the losses too. I will say there is an irony in some of this, which is that those private credit funds that do use leverage, they get the leverage from the banks that they're meant to be replacing. Apparently, what's going on here is that some of the banks, what they're really worried about is lending to individual credits, to individual companies, but they don't mind it as much. They don't mind helping provide credit to that sector of medium-sized companies if they're giving the money to a private credit fund, which is diversifying the loans that it's giving out. If the bank has that first lost position in the private credit fund, the private credit fund behaves a bit like a CLO in that sense. They have the exposure to the safest bit of the credit fund and then the owners of the credit fund have the equity. That's a nice way of divvying up risk. You give banks the safer bit of the risk and then you allocate risk to the people who are best placed to take that risk and who want to take the risk. This is how finance should work. I agree. I have mildly warm feelings towards this trend, but I also want to acknowledge all the stuff that I don't know and that this is very early in the popularization of these funds. They've become more and more popular since the great financial crisis of 2008, 2009, but they've really taken off in the course of the last year. Now, all of these big private equity firms are getting into this business. One thing I guess that could happen is that the trend goes too far when there's a ton of lending. It could fuel some asset bubbles somewhere. I don't know, but I agree that the trend itself is- We can have a growing economy. Oh no! Small businesses could have access to capital. What? No. Slate Money is sponsored by NetSuite, which is a piece of software for medium-sized businesses.

Elizabeth Fong My number is 88.5 million, and that's the number of Americans who have a tattoo. And I learned this from a press release, basically promoting something called National Tattoo Removal Day, which is apparently August 14th. I love that PR firms can just do this. So I'm going to unilaterally declare next Friday, National Slate Money Day. And I expect to... Matthew Fong Or do you think anybody should do this? No, I think it's a very democratic kind of thing. Matthew Fong Can I just say, by the way, we're in the studio, our listeners obviously can't see us. You have a very cool tattoo. Matthew Fong Elizabeth is looking... It's very sleeveless today. There used to be a time when Elizabeth would come into the studio sporting one very thin line of a tattoo, and we were like, ooh, look at that elegant minimal tattoo. And now her other arm is covered in snakes and flowers and things. Yeah, she's gone maximalist on the other arm. Elizabeth Mott Yeah, I think barring the possibility that Felix has a small portrait of Jay Powell somewhere discreet, I'm probably the only... Matthew Fong Janet Yellen, Janet Yellen. Matthew Fong The only slate money host who has tattoos too. Matthew Fong My number is 600. Matthew Fong I'm trying to guess. Matthew Fong Which is the number of individuals on this year's Forbes 30 under 30 list. Matthew Fong Wow. That's a lot. Matthew Fong You would think that a 30 under 30 list would have... Matthew Fong 30? Matthew Fong 30? Matthew Fong People on there? Matthew Fong Isn't that what it means? Matthew Fong Yeah. Matthew Fong Somehow this is 600 under 30, but I guess that just doesn't have the same ring. Matthew Fong Split up categories? Is that what's going on here? Matthew Fong I have no idea. The whole thing is dumb as sand. Matthew Fong I also think it's bad. I think it's a bad societal influence. It's like cigarettes, I think. 30 under 30. Matthew Fong Friends don't let friends be 30 under 30 influences. Yes. Matthew Fong Makes you feel like a failure if by 31 you haven't conquered the world or whatever. Matthew Fong Back when it was 30, you felt that it was a meaningful thing. Now it's 600. It's like anyone can be a 30 under 30 at this point. Matthew Fong Do you think there's a higher share of sociopaths on 30 under 30 than in the general population? Matthew Fong Yes. Matthew Fong Almost certainly. Matthew Fong One of my favorite things is to look back at these lists 20 years later or 10 years later and see how many people are under investigation for some kind of financial fraud because it's always a non-zero number. Matthew Fong Right. Yeah. So we should come back and- Matthew Fong It's too many people to follow now. Matthew Fong Yeah. We're going to need to get an AI to do that. Like back when it was 30, you could go down the list and go like under indictment in jail. Like when it's 600, that's just too much work. You need to get ChatGPT to do that for you. Matthew Fong I like the idea that Interpol automatically opens a file on you if you make a 30 under 30 list, right? Like it's just going to follow you for the rest of your life and just like, you know- Matthew Fong It's not a bad heuristic to be honest. What's your number, Cardiff? Matthew Fong You guys had cool numbers. Now I'm a little worried that mine is too dorky, but here it is. Matthew Fong Dorky is good. We like dorky numbers. Matthew Fong My number is 1.45 percentage points. Matthew Fong Ooh, I admit it. It's a percentage points. That's a good number. Matthew Fong 145 basis points maybe would be applicable here. So that is how much more you'll get paid in annualized yield if you have a three month treasury than if you have a 10 year treasury. Matthew Fong Oh, the famous inverted yield curve. I was wondering whether this was going to be an inverted yield curve number and guess what? It's the three month, 10 year inversion. It has been inverted for what? Like over a year now? Matthew Fong We are on number 10. And here's why this is interesting. If you go all the way back to the 1960s and you use this particular part of the yield curve, when it's inverted for more than three months, it has always been followed by a recession and there have been no false signals, which means that every recession has also been preceded by this kind of a yield curve inversion. Here's the thing though, on average it has taken about 11 months from the date of the initial inversion to the start of the recession and we are on month number 10. But before the great financial crisis, it took 21 months. So there can be a lag and there's no guarantee that this indicator of a potential recession is going to hold forever. At some point, that relationship could break and that's what people are speculating about right now. Matthew Fong Soft landing baby. Matthew Fong I hope so. I prefer a healthy economy to a bad economy. Matthew Fong But also we did actually have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth in the middle there. Now, that wasn't an NBER recession. But if you want to pick your definition of recession, then maybe it still stands. Aaron Ross Yeah. I mean, I followed the methodology used by a guy named Campbell Harvey, who originally came up with the recession predictive abilities of the yield curve in the 1980s, partly because he's been using this methodology from before the last few recessions. So it's not like going back and then like cherry picking the specific version of the yield curve that works. But like, this all should just be part of a lot of information that you absorb about the economy. There's nothing guaranteed. There's nothing definitive. But I'd like it as a number. Matthew Fong It's a good number. I have this theory that an inverted yield curve basically just means rates are going up. We're in a tightening cycle. And most of the time when the Fed starts tightening, that causes at least a mild recession. And if it doesn't this time, that's great. And it shows the Fed's either more powerful or less powerful, depending on how you want to look at it. Aaron Ross I'm rooting for them. We should all be. Matthew Fong Yeah, I feel like the American economy's ability to stay strong in the face of 11 consecutive rate hikes is we should be proud of that as Americans. Aaron Ross Damn right. Matthew Fong Yeah. Well done, Sleat Money listeners. As long as you go out and spend money on travel. Aaron Ross Domestic travel. Matthew Fong Swimming pools. Aaron Ross Kitchen gadgets.
